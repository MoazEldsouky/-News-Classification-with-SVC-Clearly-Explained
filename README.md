# News Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVC)

Welcome to the News Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVC) repository! ðŸ“°ðŸš€

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying news articles into different categories. The Support Vector Machines algorithm is a powerful tool for classification tasks, and in this project, we apply it to the task of categorizing news articles based on their content.

## Features

- **SVM Implementation:** Utilize the Scikit-learn library to implement Support Vector Machines for text classification.
- **News Dataset:** Use a labeled dataset of news articles for training and testing the model.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data for better model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the SVM model using appropriate metrics.
- **Clear Explanation:** Thorough documentation and code comments to help users understand the implementation.
